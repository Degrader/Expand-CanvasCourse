# Expand-CanvasCourse
Intended to take a Canvas '.imscc' file, and generate either a repaired HTML structure for local use, or converts the exported html course documents to pdf with wkhtmltopdf.

Major update from previous version. This version does not have a standalone module anymore. It is all in the GUI, which is all in one form now!

The included .exe is the PowerShell document compiled in Sapien PowerShell Studio.
